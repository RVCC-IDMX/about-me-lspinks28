        <h2>The Life of Samuel Johnson</h2>

        <div>

            <p>I asked him if it was not hard that one deviation from chastity should so absolutely ruin a young woman. Johnson. 'Why, no, Sir; it is the great principle which she is taught. When she has given up that principle, she has given up every notion of female honour and virtue, which are all included in chastity.'</p>

            <p>A gentleman talked to him of a lady whom he greatly admired and wished to marry, but was afraid of her superiority of talents. 'Sir, (said he,) you need not be afraid; marry her. Before a year goes about, you'll find that reason much weaker, and that wit not so bright.' Yet the gentleman may be justified in his apprehension by one of Dr. Johnson's admirable sentences in his life of Waller: 'He doubtless praised many whom he would have been afraid to marry; and, perhaps, married one whom he would have been ashamed to praise. Many qualities contribute to domestic happiness, upon which poetry has no colours to bestow; and many airs and sallies may delight imagination, which he who flatters them never can approve.'</p>
            
            <p>He praised Signor Baretti. 'His account of Italy is a very entertaining book; and, Sir, I know no man who carries his head higher in conversation than Baretti. There are strong powers in his mind. He has not, indeed, many hooks; but with what hooks he has, he grapples very forcibly.'</p>
            
            <p>At this time I observed upon the dial-plate of his watch a short Greek inscription, taken from the New Testament, [Greek text omitted], being the first words of our SAVIOUR'S solemn admonition to the improvement of that time which is allowed us to prepare for eternity: 'the night cometh when no man can work.' He sometime afterwards laid aside this dial-plate; and when I asked him the reason, he said, 'It might do very well upon a clock which a man keeps in his closet; but to have it upon his watch which he carries about with him, and which is often looked at by others, might be censured as ostentatious.' Mr. Steevens is now possessed of the dial-plate inscribed as above.</p>
            
            <p>He remained at Oxford a considerable time; I was obliged to go to London, where I received his letter, which had been returned from Scotland.</p>
            
            <p>'TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
            
            <p>'MY DEAR BOSWELL,--I have omitted a long time to write to you, without knowing very well why. I could now tell why I should not write; for who would write to men who publish the letters of their friends, without their leave? Yet I write to you in spite of my caution, to tell you that I shall be glad to see you, and that I wish you would empty your head of Corsica, which I think has filled it rather too long. But, at all events, I shall be glad, very glad to see you. I am, Sir, yours affectionately,</p>
            
            <p>'SAM. JOHNSON.'</p>

        <h2>Unveiling the Magic of CSS Animation</h2>
        <p>CSS animation is a crucial technique in the web development toolbox that may captivate visitors and improve user experience. It enables developers to give life to inanimate objects, grabbing users' attention and directing interaction. Together, we will study and unearth the mysteries of the fascinating world of CSS animation.<p>
        <h3>What is CSS Animation?</h3>
        <p>With CSS transitions and keyframes, web items may be animated using CSS animation. In contrast to conventional animation techniques that depend on JavaScript or Flash, CSS animation presents a compact and effective resolution. With its help, developers may add dynamic elements to websites without compromising on speed by animating characteristics like position, size, color, and opacity.<p>
        <h3>How is CSS Animation Used?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Enhancing User Engagement:</strong> CSS animations are frequently used to spruce up user interfaces and improve the usability and engagement of interactions. A visitor is captivated and encouraged to explore via CSS animation, which ranges from modest hover effects to eye-catching loading animations.</li>
          <li><strong>Visual Storytelling:</strong> Developers may visually tell stories and take users on a smooth journey by using CSS animation. Websites can successfully convey tales and create a lasting impression by emphasizing crucial components or animating transitions between information sections.</li>
          <li><strong>Functional Feedback:</strong>CSS animation has a practical benefit beyond aesthetics by responding to user input. For example, animated form validation messages improve usability and lower errors by providing explicit feedback on user input.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Crafting CSS Animation:</h3>
        <p>Let's use a straightforward example to demonstrate the power of CSS animation. Imagine a button that changes color and scales elegantly when the button is hovered over. The CSS code to accomplish this effect is as follows:<p>
        <pre>
          <code class="language-css">
      .button {
        background-color: #3498db;
        color: #fff;
        padding: 10px 20px;
        border: none;
        border-radius: 5px;
        transition: transform 0.3s, background-color 0.3s;
      }
      
      .button:hover {
        transform: scale(1.1);
        background-color: #2980b9;
      }
          </code>
        </pre>
      
        <p>And here's the button in action:</p>
        <button class="button">Hover Me</button>
      
        <p>The options are unlimited when it comes to CSS animation. With CSS animation, developers may create complex visual experiences or add subtle subtleties that will captivate and please consumers.<p>
        <p>allow your imagination run wild and allow CSS animation bring your online designs to life!</p>
