## Description
Greetings! I'm Lawrence Spinks, and welcome to my "About Me" project. Here, I showcase my skills and background in web development through an engaging and educational personal website.

I've meticulously organized the content of my website to ensure accessibility and ease of use for all users. Leveraging HTML, I've structured the layout, while CSS allowed me to craft an aesthetically pleasing interface that reflects my personality.

## Color Scheme
For this project, I've curated a color scheme that embodies my aesthetic sensibilities and personality:

- **Main Navy**:
  - RGB: 35, 57, 92
  - Hex: #23395C
  
- **Accent Orange**:
  - RGB: 239, 147, 24
  - Hex: #EF9318

- **White Smoke**:
  - RGB: 245, 245, 245
  - Hex: #F5F5F5

These colors harmonize to create an eye-catching design. Here's how they're utilized throughout the project:

### Update for the Image Gallery
In this version, I've enhanced the image gallery with chic picture frame borders and soft hover effects for increased engagement. I've also adjusted the grid template columns to ensure better layout consistency across different screen sizes.

### Updated Profile Photo
Furthermore, I've replaced my profile photo with a more suitable version. The square shape and photographic quality enhance the professionalism and aesthetic appeal of the image.

## Nav Bar 
In my bar added links to new sections on my webpage. I tried to add the hamburger icon on my page but I could't get it to work properly for smaller screens such as phones.
