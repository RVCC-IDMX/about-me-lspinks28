# Description
Greetings from my "About Me" project! This project, which I developed my name is Lawrence Spinks, this project will be an example of my abilities and background in web development. I've developed and used a variety of skills and technologies over this project to make an interesting and educational personal website.

I concentrated on efficiently organizing my website's content in the Html area to make sure that it was accessible and easy to use for everyone. I developed my layout and styling abilities through Css, producing an aesthetically pleasing interface that captures my essence.

# Color Scheme
I've selected a color scheme for my project that embodies both my aesthetic sensibilities and personality. The following are the primary colors: 

 **Main Navy**:
  - RGB: 35, 57, 92
  - Hex: #23395C
  
 **Accent Orange**:
  RGB: 239, 147, 24
  Hex: #EF9318

 **white smoke**:
 RGB: 245, 245, 245
 Hex: #F5F5F5

These colors were chosen with care to provide a harmonious and eye-catching design. Here are some illustrations of how these hues are utilized throughout the project: 

## Update for the Image Gallery
With this version, I've made a lot of enhancements to the image gallery. For more engagement, the photos now include a chic picture frame border and a soft hover effect. In order to guarantee a better layout across a range of screen sizes, the grid template columns have also been modified.

## Updated Profile Photo
Additionally, I changed the photo on my profile to a more fitting version of myself. The square shape and photographic appearance added to the profile image improves its professionalism and aesthetic appeal.
